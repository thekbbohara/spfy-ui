# SPFYUI

## Why spfyui ?

- _SpfyUI was created to address a common issue faced by developers when integrating icons and UI components into React projects: the limitation of predefined icon sets and the bloat of installing multiple packages. Often, popular libraries like react-icons or remix-icons don't include all the icons or components you need. SpfyUI solves this problem by allowing you to dynamically add any icon or UI component from various providers on-demand. And just the thought of adding unnecessary stuff in mycodebase just turns me off._
